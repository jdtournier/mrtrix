#summary Installation on Microsoft Windows

= Installation =

Thanks to Ben Jeurissen, installation on Windows is simply a matter of downloading and executing the relevant mrtrix-0.2.X-win32.exe (available from the [http://www.nitrc.org/projects/mrtrix/ NITRC website]). 

Note that as of version 0.2.7, there is no need to install the associated mrtrix-0.2.X-win32-deps.exe package, as the relevant dependencies are now already included.
