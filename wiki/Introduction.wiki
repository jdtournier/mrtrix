#summary Introduction.

= Introduction =
MRtrix provides a set of tools to perform diffusion-weighted MRI white matter tractography in the presence of crossing fibres, using Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (Tournier et al.. 2004; Tournier et al. 2007), and a probabilisitic streamlines algorithm (e.g. Behrens et al., 2003; Parker et al., 2003). These applications have been written from scratch in C++, using the functionality provided by the [http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ GNU Scientific Library], and [http://www.gtkmm.org/ gtkmm]. The software is currently capable of handling DICOM and AnalyseAVW image formats, amongst others. The source code is distributed under the GNU General Public License.
